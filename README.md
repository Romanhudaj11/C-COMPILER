# C-COMPILER
C++ project: compiles C-code to MIPS assembly language. Includes all stages of compilation in separate executable files and as a single project. 

This project was developped for CS241: Foundations of Sequential Programs over the course of the Winter 2023 semester. 

## Features 

## MIPS?

MIPS Assembly Langage (MAL) is the assembly language for MIPS processors. It is currently one of the major processors in the embedded processor market.

Although ARM is a more standardly used, the foundations of MIPS and ARM are the same. And for the purpose of creating a compiler, the techniques are roughly the same. 

You can check out some examples of MIPS programs that I created by following this link:
