# Overview 
* Assembler for MIPS assembly language 
* Written in C++ 

**Steps:**

1. Scanning the input
  2. Scanner provides an input to the program: tokens (without whitespace or comments) 
3. Identify the instructions (and the register values or immediate values)
4. do error checking (output error messages if invalid) 
5. instructions into binary and output them to stdout

**Note:** A scanner need to be used in this step for the assembler to work. However, only the assembler part is what we care about here.
